## Notes
This is Foggy's KOTG build on Amazonia. It's actually really smart. Instead of building an archer
you creep only with AoW + KotG and can take both camps at once. Let your treeants fight green camp
while AoW + KotG fight orange camp.

You do this to avoid building any archers so you can straight to hunts.

## Other takeaways
- Get a wisp at merc camp. These are your "other than dryad" units.
- Build your second Tree of Life while researching faster building mvmt speed. Uproot AoW and tree of life and move to expo.
