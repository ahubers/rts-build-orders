- 12/18~ Scout
- 15/18 Supply Depot
- 20/26 Refinery
- 24/26 Academy (see note)
- 27 Barracks

### Timing

The attack should come right before Zerg has Lair tech units (either Lurkers or
Mutalisks), and thus the build is particularly strong against 3 Hatch builds and
weak against 2 Hatch builds. The typical attack force consists of about 2
control groups of infantry, with 4-6 Medics, 2-4 Firebats, and the rest Marines.
