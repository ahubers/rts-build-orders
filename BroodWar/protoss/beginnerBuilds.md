PvZ
========================================

### Forge Fast Expand into 4 gate speedlots (med)
need to go through replay again and fix a lot of pylon et al timings.

Main goal is:
  12 forge -> 13 nexus -> pylon 
  -> 16 gateway -> 17 gas
  -> 20 cyber -> start zealots
  -> +1 attack -> citadel
  -> 36 gateway -> zealot legs
  -> 42 two more gates
  -> ~62 second gas
  -> 72 templar archives
  -> Storm as soon as archives finishes
  -> 3 HT 1 DT
  -> +2 attack
  -> ~110 robo, goon range
  -> observatory after robo
  -> more HT and zealots
  -> Start goons as soon as range is close to finishing
  -> Take a third at some point.
  -> More or less max out with 5-7 HT, fuckton of zealots and goons at ~11:30.

### gateway fast expand
Just a gist
- 8 pylon
- 10 gate
-> forge, zealots until expand at ~21
-> gas -> cyber, and at least one cannon
-> pylon to finish wall
-> stargate (once enough gas)
-> second gas
-> citadel of adun and +1/+1
-> after corsairs start, get 3 more gateways
-> Templar archives
= spead zealots, 4-5 corsairs, +2 on the way
{
  Goals:
    -> +2 attack
    -> Get some space and take third // or wait for 6 gates and expand
    -> need robo + observatory if see hydras (and thus lurkers)
	-> 
}
