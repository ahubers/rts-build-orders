# PvT

In the early-to-midgame transition, the Protoss would like to have the following:
- Two Gates producing dragoons
- dragoon range
- observers
- an expansion

After the mid game you want the other goodies like:
- upgrades
- zealot legs
- a Shuttle with zealots in it
- templar archive

and into lategame:
- arbiters

Each opening follows more or less the same formula:
constant probe production + constant goon production + tech option / expand as soon as you can afford it.

The trick is we can't get everything we want. We have to choose one to cut. Consequently, 
there's about five openings you can pick from:

## Two Gateway observer
early second gateway, fast as possible observers, but no dragoon range. expand at ~4

## 12 nexus, 14 gateway
fast expansion, delayed goons + observers.

## One gateway range
one less gateway than the two gate observer, but you have range earlier.

## Early DT
Fast forward to DTs, but skip the observers.

## Early reaver
Get everything you want early, but very late expansion (~5:00).

# PvZ

PvZ principally follows one of two pathways:
- gate fast expand
- Forge fast expand (FFE)

The gate expand works by having zealots to scout and (potentially defend),
at the cost of needing some micro to make these ends meet.
The FFE is more passive, but can be safer at times. 

## Gate First
Without explicit supply annotations:
   8 pylon
-> 10 gate
-> forge 
-> zealots + probes until you have enough money to expand
-> gas -> cyber, cannon in wall
-> stargate
-> second gas
-> citadel of adun and +1 melee && +1 air
-> corsairs
-> 3 more gates
-> templar archives
-> speed zealots, 4-5 corsairs, +2 on the way

at this point we have hopefully arrived safely in the midgame.
What we want next: 
{
  - +2 attack upgrades
  - a third and map presence!!!!
  - robo + observatory
  - Goon range and begin goon production
  - a handful of HT with storm
}

And at the very end, get carriers and say fuckit.

## FFE
- 8 pylon
- 11 forge
-> nexus, canon at wall
-> gateway to finish wall
-> gas, cyber, zealot
-> stargate ~28
-> corsair production, +1/+1
-> citadel
-> zealot legs
-> templar archives
-> storm
-> 6 total gateways
-> MAP PRESENCE AND EXPAND!
-> +2 upgrades
-> two more gates (8 total)
-> robo, goon range, observers

# PvP

The midgame convergence for each opening is:
- 4 gates
- dragoons with range
- reavers


## The Ultimate Standard
- 10 gate, 11 gas
- 1-2 zealots
- cyber
- goon production + range (with some goon cuts to hit other marks)
- second gateway
- robo as soon as you can afford it
- observatory, robo bay

if observer sees an attack coming:
- w/ attack: More goons
- no attack: expand
